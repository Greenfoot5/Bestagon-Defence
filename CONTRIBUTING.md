# Contributing

This is for code contributions.

## Basic Guidelines

### Use an IDE.
Any IDE that can understand C# is ok, but preferably one with Unity support. [You can view a full list here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ScriptingToolsIDEs.html)

### Always test your changes.
Do not submit something without at least running the game to see if it compiles.  

### Do not make large changes before discussing them first.
If you are interested in adding a large mechanic/feature or changing large amounts of code, first contact me (Greenfoot5) via [Discord](https://discord.gg/zeDey9v) (preferred method) or send an email to bestagon@alchemix.dev.
For smaller changes, this isn't required, but it's still useful if we have a chat.

### Do not make formatting PRs.
Yes, there are occurrences of trailing spaces, extra newlines, empty indents, and other tiny errors. No, I don't want to merge, view, or get notified by your 1-line PR fixing it. If you're implementing a PR with modification of *actual code*, feel free to fix formatting in the general vicinity of your changes, but please don't waste everyone's time with pointless changes.

## Other Notes
Once you've made a commit that works well, [I may add you to the credits section on the website!](https://bestagon.alchemix.dev)
If you feel I have forgotten you, feel free to remind me, but spamming me will not help (I also might not reply because I'm on holiday for example, or I'm waiting to release the version with your changes before adding you to the credits).
