    m_Localized: "Bestagon Defence is a tower defence game! This means you've got
      to place turrets to stop enemies reaching the end goal for as long as possible.\n\n<size=+25>The
      Goal<size=100%>\nYou begin with each level with a certain amount of <sprite=\"UI-Life\"
      name=\"life\">, and each time an enemy reaches they end, you lose at least
      one. You can gain more through the shop. If you lose them all, it's game over.
      The aim is therefore to make is as far as possible before you lose, aiming
      to top the leaderboards!\n\n<size=+25>The Shop<size=100%>\nThe shop is here
      to help! You can usethe hard earned <sprite=\"UI-Gold\" name=\"gold>  you gain
      from killing enemies by opening the shop. The price increases each time however.\nEach
      time you open the shop you'll get some choices. The main three are either turrets
      or modules (turret upgrades). You can only pick one thing before the shop closes.
      These three are randomised each time the shop opens. The bottom three options
      are:\n<sprite=\"UI-Life\" name=\"life\"> <color=#D41E3C>Revitalise</color>
      - Gives you some lives back\n<sprite=\"UI-Gold\" name=\"gold\"> <color=#fce544>Refund</color>
      - Gives you back some of the gold you spent opening the shop, but the price
      still increases.\n\u2022 <color=#f8663a>Reroll</color> - Spend <sprite=\"UI-Life\"
      name=\"life\">  to reroll you turret & module selection. It can cost multiple
      <sprite=\"UI-Life\" name=\"life\">  for one reroll, or one <sprite=\"UI-Life\"
      name=\"life\">  for many rerolls. They carry over between shop opens.\n\n<size=+25>Turrets
      & Modules<size=100%>"
