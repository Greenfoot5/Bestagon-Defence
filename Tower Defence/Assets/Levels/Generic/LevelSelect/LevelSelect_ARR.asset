      Each

      which turrets it can be used on:

      <sprite="T_Glyphs" name="any"> - Any

      name="laser"> - Laser

      <sprite="T_Glyphs" name="shooter"> - Shooter

      <sprite="T_Glyphs"
      name="smasher"> - Smasher


      Modules can be obtained from the shop. To
      apply one, select the turret ye wish to apply it to, select the module from
      yer inventory and hit the "Apply Module" button above the turret. Most modules
      can be applied to multiple turrets, and some to any. Check the turret glyphs
      on the module''s shop card to see what it can be applied to. Module can also
      be upgraded (up to a max level) by placing a module the the same type and level
      to a turret. Most modules can also be applied to a turret even if there''s
      one of the same type at a different level, but not all.

      gets stranded and yer not sure what a turret/module is/does, check the wiki!'
